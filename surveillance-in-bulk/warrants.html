                        <p class="c0"><span class="c8">Every day our online footprints grow. We send emails, exchange direct messages, and
                                store our documents in cloud servers that we will never see and never own. These effects that once existed
                                on papers stored in filing cabinets in back offices are now highly available from anywhere in the world-
                                from a cafe in Nepal to CIA headquarters in Virginia. With Google and Facebook holding the
                                &ldquo;keys&rdquo; to our online filing cabinets we no longer have the agency to feel secure in our effects.
                                Because the laws that govern our online privacy were written long before we understood the magnitude or
                                usefulness of the internet, we have very few protections and therefore zero confidence that the government
                                isn&rsquo;t surveilling every text and collecting every photo. In this paper, I explore the current privacy
                                protections in place on the internet, describe government surveillance that evades privacy protection, and
                                raise concerns about the escalation of government surveillance. I conclude by suggesting an alternative
                                paradigm that restores the confidence of United States citizens that their fourth amendment rights still
                                exist in the age of information.</span></p>
                        <h2 class="c15" id="h.28130dqqgvox"><span class="c7">Overview</span></h2>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c8">This work is divided into four sections. In the first section, I describe the legal
                                mechanisms that allow the government to surveil information stored by private companies. My intent is to
                                highlight the grey areas of the law that these mechanisms inhabit. The second section presents aggregated
                                data from the transparency reports of some of the tech giants. The data in these transparency reports
                                establish the magnitude of the problem. Next, I provide concrete examples of how surveillance harms
                                individuals via misinterpretation of the data and harms the economy by throttling our ability to export our
                                technology. Finally, I present a panel of solutions, ranging from legal changes that could put the United
                                States on track for a more equitable internet.</span></p>

                                enforcement officer must follow in order to search or seize private property. It was drafted in response to
                                King George&rsquo;s &ldquo;writs of assistance&rdquo; which allowed the king&rsquo;s agents to rifle through

                        <p class="c0"><span class="c8">To obtain a warrant, a law enforcement officer must convince a judge that their
                                search would meet three requirements: 1. Probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation. This requires
                                that the officer have a reason to suspect that a crime is being committed. This prevents &ldquo;fishing
                                expeditions&rdquo; where law enforcement searches indiscriminately until they find a crime. 2. A description
                                of the place to be searched. Law enforcement must be clear about the scope of their search. This prevents
                                officers from violating the privacy of entire neighborhoods. 3. The persons or things to be seized. It is
                                insufficient to claim that a crime is being committed without understanding what that crime is and who is
                                committing it. Simply looking &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; does not give law enforcement a right to
                                search.</span></p>

                                Geofenced warrants are warrants issued to a tech company commanding that they disclose identifying
                                information about every device that was present at a given location at a given point in time. Police then

                                not, center on the government&rsquo;s ability to monitor online activity. To quote Justice Brandeis in his

                        <p class="c0"><span class="c8">Utah Law profession Matthew Tokson offers five alternatives to the inescapability
                                clause that would better equip courts to rule on fourth amendment protections for online data. Of these five
                                solutions, I&rsquo;ve identified two that are not only legally sound but also robust from a data science
                                perspective. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0 c10"><span class="c8"></span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c26">The Normative Approach</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span>The normative approach asks judges to extend fourth amendment protection to information that an
                                individual </span><span class="c17">should</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;feel secure in. This approach would
                                ask judges to build a body of precedence independent from societal expectations of privacy. Tokson offers
                                this alternative as a solution that would adapt well to new technology by encouraging judges to think
                                critically about every new method of information surveillance. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0 c10"><span class="c8"></span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span>As a data scientist, I find this approach appealing because it removed societal expectations
                                from the equation. Even among the data-native generation, only 43% believe that they are data literate
                                (</span><span class="c5"><a class="c4"
                                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-literacy-gap-among-young-people-could-impact-businesses/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650557133775208&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Y0b2Op7_9IQ3lshBI5cLi">Vigliarolo
                                    2021</a></span><span class="c8">), and asking societal expectations of privacy to drive the debate would
                                mean that data privacy always lags behind new innovations. A normative approach coupled with amicus briefs
                                by technologists would better prepare judges to handle surveillance cases than our current
                                frameworks.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0 c10"><span class="c8"></span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c24">The Positive Law Regime</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c8">While the normative approach is an acceptable framework, I advocate most strongly for
                                the positive law approach. Positive law would extend fourth amendment protection to all information that
                                would be &ldquo;illegal or tortious&rdquo; for a private citizen to obtain. For example, I expect that my
                                geolocation data cannot be accessed by my neighbor. Therefore, it should be protected by the fourth
                                amendment.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0 c10"><span class="c8"></span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span>I find this simple to implement and easily adaptable from both a legal perspective and a data
                                science perspective. A judge would not even need to necessarily understand the technology at hand. They
                                could simply ask the company holding the information if they would yield it up to a non-government agent
                                willingly, and extend fourth amendment protections if the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</span></p>
                        <h3 class="c13" id="h.5rakvf8svh3q"><span class="c12">Establishing a Dialog</span></h3>
                        <p class="c0"><span>Whether we choose to adopt the normative approach, the positive law regime, or some other
                                framework, we cannot hope to reign in government surveillance without allowing pluralism in the discourse.
                                990 FISA warrants with gag orders were issued in 2019 (</span><span class="c5"><a class="c4"
                                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/fisc_annual_report_2019_0.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650557133776932&amp;usg=AOvVaw0oGFi-kfXEwLu18aVG22K3">Duff
                                    2019</a></span><span class="c8">). In order to remove the gag order, a recipient must pursue litigation
                                against the gag order. For free speech advocates like the ACLU, this means potentially submitting 990
                                individual requests. With well over 90% of all FISA warrants kept secret by the FBI, how can we hope to have
                                a democratic debate about their merits? </span></p>
                        <p class="c0 c10"><span class="c8"></span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span>The solution lies in opening up the FISA courts. In 2015 free speech advocates won a small
                                victory by permitting amici curiae to counsel FISA judges. While this is a step away from autocracy, it
                                cannot qualify as a step toward democracy. We cannot hope to truly identify equitable solutions to
                                government surveillance without exposing FISA rulings to the scrutiny of democracy.</span>
