                                        our concern for the people
                                        of Baltimore and the magnitude of risks posed to them by the release of these
                                        data sets and information.
                                </span><span class="c0">We will examine the legal and ethical implications associated

                                        inventory, which contains hundreds of public data sets. Furthermore, the city
                                        hopes to facilitate the
                                        data-driven work requirements of its employees by consolidating data and making
                                        it available in one place.
                                        The focus of this letter is the data sets related to arrests, 9/11 calls, and
                                        the administration of Naloxone

                                        repercussions. First,
                                        every adult in the United States has the right to due process. This means that
                                        suspects should be considered
                                        innocent until proven guilty. By releasing murder arrests on social media, the
                                        Police often strip suspects
                                        of this right. Briefly looking at the comments section of the posts,
                                        you&rsquo;ll see that the community
                                        often writes hateful comments about the individuals under the assumption that
                                        they are already guilty.
                                        Posting to social media amplifies unequal treatment by allowing people to take
                                        part in the conversation
                                        regarding serious legal matters. What if the suspect is deemed innocent? Does
                                        Baltimore post any type of
                                        correction to the dataset and social media? If not, the suspect has incurred
                                        unjust slander. Additionally,
                                        the victims and their families could be reidentified based on the data. This
                                        could cause unnecessary pain
                                        and suffering to the families of the victims. The suspects, victims, and
                                        victims&rsquo; family members did
                                        not consent to their information being publicly disseminated to citizens.
                                        Lastly, there are risks associated
                                        with secondary use of this data. With victims identified, funeral homes and
                                        attorneys could send targeted
                                        advertisements to the families of the victims. Additionally, the media could
                                        target the families and the
                                        communities of the victim for interviews and comments. Similarly, attorneys and
                                        the media could target the

                                        the various methods
                                        discussed above. What we must also consider is how the release of these data
                                        sets poses a risk to different
                                        racial groups, especially minorities.</span></p>

                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, people of Asian descent are present in so few
                                        numbers in the data that
                                        it poses a risk to their personal safety. Only 2% of Baltimore&rsquo;s
                                        population is Asian according to 2020
                                        census data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). With the rise in hate crimes against
                                        people of Asian descent
                                        throughout the United States, the re-identification possibilities with these
                                        datasets could exacerbate an
                                        already horrific situation that is unfolding in the country by informing
                                        attackers, for example, of
                                        locations or zip codes where Asian people have been arrested or been victims of
                                        a crime. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Black men are the most prominent group in the arrest records, and
                                        we were able to
                                        deduce this because of the inclusion of the race column in the arrest records.
                                        There is a tremendous risk of
                                        racial profiling as a result of the overrepresentation of minority groups such
                                        as Black men in the arrest
                                        record data. This puts already marginalized communities at risk for further
                                        trauma and can compromise the
                                        safety of the community in its entirety&ndash;something that we have seen time
                                        and time again with racial
                                        profiling taking the lives of so many people of color, specifically Black

                                        Because of the frankly inconceivable gravity of dangers the inclusion of race in
                                        these datasets poses, we
                                        encourage you to think about whether the utility of including this race in these
                                        datasets outweighs the
                                        risks it poses to the wellbeing and privacy of the individual members in these
                                        communities. Furthermore, for
                                        the protection of at-risk populations and minorities, as stressed above, we
                                        strongly urge that social media
                                        posts be purged as well. </span></p>

                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nissenbaum&#39;s framework for contextual integrity supports the

                                        only when there is a specific use for it. For the purposes that the government
                                        of Baltimore has given for
                                        this data being released, it is not immediately clear why race is included as a
                                        column. If one goal of
                                        making this data public is to improve transparency, then we recommend including
                                        an explanation of why each
                                        column in the data is included at such a low granularity in the first place.
                                        Thus the government can either
                                        be clear with its intention for including the column or move to remove it
                                        altogether if there is no such
                                        justifiable reason.</span></p>

                        <p class="c1"><span>In order to prevent the release of personally identifiable data or any other
                                        data that could put
                                        the privacy or personal safety of any individual at risk, it is critical that
                                        there be a standardized review
                                        process and a code of conduct that audits each data set before its release. For
                                        Open Baltimore specifically,
                                        a review process will further their goal of accountability by granting agency to
                                        the public to determine
                                        what information is available to the world. For the data itself, this might
                                        decrease its utility, but more
                                        importantly, it will accomplish a higher level of privacy and protection for the

                                        present in the data sets. For example, a deep dive into the arrest records data
                                        via a review process may
                                        have been able to reveal the privacy harms we identified in this document and
